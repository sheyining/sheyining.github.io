### Overview

Modern driving assistance systems are equipped with powerful sensors that can better perceive the driving environment compared to human drivers. The discrepancies in the perception of the driving environment by the driver and the system affect the driver's trust towards the driving assistance system and thus driving safety. A driving assistance system that infers the driver's decision process can improve the quality of driving assistance as well as the driver's acceptability of the system.

We propose a cognitive digital twin framework that models and learns the driver's decision process. Three parts are included in this framework: 

1. Driver's Cognitive Model
2. Cognitive Digital Twin Identification
3. Intelligent Driving Assist System
