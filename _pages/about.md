I am a third-year PhD student in Software Engineering at [Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Eunsuk Kang](https://eskang.github.io/). 

My research interests are mainly in the intersection of **Software Engineering (SE)** and **Artificial Intelligence**. I design methods and build tools to empower developers to evaluate and analyze the safety, robustness, &fairness of AI systems, and design better systems. 
<!-- I want to leverage SE techniques to help design safe and reliable AI systems, as well as investigate new applications of AI for software development. -->

My recent work focuses on enhancing the safety of **Large Language Model Agents** by designing external toolkits that provide systematic guardrails against risky actions. Previously, I developed *[FairSense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01665)* for proactive analysis of long-term fairness issues that specifically considers feedback loop interaction between AI system and environment.

Before joining CMU, I received my bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), where I worked with [Dr. Zhihao Jiang](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/jiangzhh/) at [Human-Cyber-Physical Systems Lab](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/jiangzhh/team/).

If you are interested in my research and collaboration, please feel free to reach out.
